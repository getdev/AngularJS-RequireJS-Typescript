# AngularJS-RequireJS-Typescript

I'm trying to reach the best approach for using both [ AngularJS & RequireJS ] with TypeScript ,
I found many demos but they all didn't include [on demand loading] for controllers , services , ... registered in the module ...
anyway here is a simple demo i developed & i want to know your opinion about its efficiency

ENJOY :)
